Welcome to Vega's documentation!
======================================

Vega is a tool for computing 3D correlation function models for tracers used by the Ly-:math:`\alpha` forest group (such as Ly-:math:`\alpha` flux, Quasar positions or different metal lines) and for fitting data produced by `picca <https://github.com/igmhub/picca>`__ primarily to measure Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).
